## Abstract

Speech-based Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) detection has gained attention for its automated, cost-effective, and non-intrusive nature. As research studies usually rely on data from diagnostic-oriented speech tasks, this work explores the feasibility of diagnosing PD on the basis of speech data not originally intended for diagnostic purposes, using the Turn-Taking (TT) dataset. Our findings indicate that TT can be as useful as diagnostic-oriented PD datasets like PC-GITA. We also investigate which specific dataset characteristics impact PD classification performance. The results show that concatenating audio recordings and balancing participants‚Äô gender and status distributions can be beneficial. Cross-dataset evaluation reveals that models trained on PC-GITA generalize poorly to TT, whereas models trained on TT perform better on PC-GITA. Furthermore, we provide insights into the high variability across folds, which is mainly due to large differences in individual speaker performance.

Preprocess finished.
(Optional) Script to calculate basic statistics of the training set:
    
    python cal_basic.py dummy_splits/TRAIN_TEST_1


### Training

For model training, we follow exactly the same procedure as in the SSL4PR project: https://github.com/K-STMLab/SSL4PR/tree/main



### Validation 

[modified implementation:](https://github.com/terryyizhongru/SSL4PR)

Modifications:
1. Fixed AUC-ROC Computation 
   - Corrected an error in the AUC-ROC calculation to ensure accurate metric reporting.

2. Added `eval.py` for more convenient Evaluation
   - Generates detailed performance reports, including by_speaker, by_gender performance metrics
   - Configure via `W_config_eval.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     by_speaker: true  
     by_gender:  false  
     ```
   - Supported datasets: pcgita, TurnTaking

3.  Updated data loader to support TurnTaking Dataset  


### Visualization

- The code for the two paper figures is available in the `visualization` directory:  
    - `visualization/plot1.ipynb`  
    - `visualization/plot2.ipynb`
